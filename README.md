## About me

Hello, my name is Johannes Willem (Hans) Fernhout.
My interest is in C and Python programming.
I contribute to [Gentoo](www.gentoo.org), by proxy maintaining some packages, and extending the wiki.
Software that I develop include [krapplet](https://gitlab.com/hfernh/krapplet) (a password manager), and [iwdgui](https://gitlab.com/hfernh/iwdgui) (a frontend for [IWD](https://iwd.wiki.kernel.org/).

I work for [Oracle](www.oracle.com); all opinions, views and software here are my own, not my Oracle's.
