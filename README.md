## About me

Hello, my name is Johannes Willem (Hans) Fernhout.
My interest is in C and Python programming.
I also contribute sometimes to [Gentoo](www.gentoo.org), be it in proxy maintaining some packages, or extending the wiki.
Software that I develop include [krapplet](https://gitlab.com/hfernh/krapplet), and [iwdgui](https://gitlab.com/hfernh/iwdgui).
I work for Oracle; any opinions, views or software are my own, not my employer's.
